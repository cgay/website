Hello, World!
*************

The canonical "Hello World" program in Dylan.

File library.dylan:

.. code-block:: dylan

  Module: dylan-user

  define library hello
    use dylan;
    use io, import: { format-out };
  end;

  define module hello
    use dylan;
    use format-out;
  end;

File hello.dylan:

.. code-block:: dylan

  Module: hello

  format-out("Hello!\n");


**How it works:**

1. Every Dylan program defines a library and at least one module in
   that library, and the simple Hello World program is no exception.

#. Every source file must have a ``Module`` header to say which module its definitions
   should be in. The library is defined in the pre-existing ``dylan-user`` module.

#. The top level expressions in each source file are executed in order when the library
   is loaded, so there is no need for a ``main`` method here.
