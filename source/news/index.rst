Website Revamp - 2023-07-07
===========================

The opendylan.org website has had a long overdue major overhaul. The goals of
this revamp were:

1. Enable better navigation between different sections of the website. For
   example, when reading documentation in the Library Reference it should be
   easy to navigate to the Hacker Guide or to package docs. Now everything is
   accessible from the left sidebar (the ``:toctree:`` in reStructured Text
   terminology).

#. Improved accessibility. The old site had a very low contrast top navbar and
   other low contrast elements. The new `Furo
   <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_ theme has much better contrast
   plus light and dark themes.

#. Local table of contents in the right sidebar. Hooray `Furo
   <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_!

#. Integrated :doc:`package docs <../package/index>`.

#. Simplicity! We're a small team so we want to avoid any extra maintenance
   burden. To that end, we no longer use a Dylan-specific Sphinx theme or
   templates. If it ain't in `Furo <https://pradyunsg.me/furo/quickstart/>`_,
   we don't want it! :-)

We'd love to hear feedback on the new site. You can `file a bug
<https://github.com/dylan-lang/website/issues>`_ or `drop us a note on Matrix
<https://app.element.io/#/room/#dylan-language:matrix.org>`_.
