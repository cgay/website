  is in a specific library repository you can report it there instead. If unsure, use

The Dylan Language room on Matrix
  This is where day-to-day Dylan activity takes place. You may sign in with a
  GitHub, GitLab, Google, etc. and any Matrix client. For example, the
  Element web client link is:

  `https://app.element.io/#/room/#dylan-language:matrix.org <https://app.element.io/#/room/#dylan-language:matrix.org>`_

  To discuss coding issues you can use https://play.opendylan.org to share an example, or
  `create a gist on GitHub <https://gist.github.com>`_ and paste a link to it.

.. _mailing-lists:

Mailing List
  dylan-lang@googlegroups.com, also `browsable on the web
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dylan-lang>`_, is dedicated to discussion of
  Dylan.  If you have a question that's more detailed or doesn't required the quick
  back-and-forth of IRC, this is the preferred place for it.

  `comp.lang.dylan
  <http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/comp.lang.dylan>`_ also exists,
  but dylan-lang@ is the preferred forum.
